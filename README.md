# D-Emu

D-Emu is a Game Boy emulator written with the [language D](https://dlang.org/).

Since, there is a dozen of existing GB emulators written in various programming languages, this one was created just for academic purpose:
 * to discover the Game Boy hardware;
 * to understand how old games was programmed;
 * to learn the D programming language, its current limitations and study if it is possible to write an efficient and well-designed implementation.

Being as accurate as possible to enable running many games without any crashes or glitches is one of the main concern of D-Emu.
However, the implementation also has to be efficient while keeping a readable and maintainable code.
As a result, D-Emu aims to achieve a balance between accuracy, performance and maintainability.
